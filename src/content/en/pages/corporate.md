  title: "Our Story"
  content:
    - "MATERIX Nano Technology Inc. is a nanotechnology-focused venture representing a union of industry and academia. Our business idea, which ranked 5th in Turkey's leading \"Women Entrepreneurship in Innovation Camp\", won a grant under the KOSGEB R&D, Product Development and Innovation Support Program and took root at DEPARK (Dokuz Eylul University Technopark) in January 2022."
    - "In June 2022, with the completion of our hydrophobic nano film product prototype, we entered the sector by establishing a workshop in Zone Gaziemir. In order to improve the surface properties of materials, we prefer to only change the material on the surface."
